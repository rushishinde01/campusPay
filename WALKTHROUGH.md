### Script

**(0:00 - 0:25) The Hook**
*   **Visual**: Face camera or Title Slide.
*   **Say**: "Hi, I'm [Name]. Trying to split bills or buy concert tickets from strangers is risky. Venmo offers no protection if you get scammed. That's why I built **CampusPay**—a trustless payment system for students."

**(0:25 - 0:45) The Tech**
*   **Visual**: Show Home Screen. Scroll to show design.
*   **Say**: "CampusPay runs on the **Algorand Blockchain** for speed and security. It's built with **React**, **AlgoKit**, and **Tailwind CSS v4** for this 'Industrial Luxury' aesthetic."

**(0:45 - 1:10) Design & Connect**
*   **Visual**: Toggle Theme (Sun/Moon). Disconnect/Reconnect Wallet.
*   **Say**: "The UI is fully responsive with a seamless Dark Mode. Connecting is secure and non-custodial using **Pera Connect**."

**(1:10 - 1:35) Instant Payments**
*   **Visual**: Click "Pay" -> Enter Address -> Send 1 ALGO.
*   **Say**: "For coffee runs, I use Direct Pay. I enter an address, click Send, and thanks to Algorand's **3.3s finality**, it's done instantly."
*   **Visual**: Point to "Transaction Confirmed" toast.

**(1:35 - 1:55) Create Escrow**
*   **Visual**: Click "Escrow" (Shield Icon). Enter Receiver & Amount.
*   **Say**: "But for buying textbooks, I use **Trustless Escrow**. I lock my funds in a Smart Contract so they are safe until I get the item. No middleman needed."

**(1:55 - 2:20) Manage Escrow (The Killer Feature)**
*   **Visual**: Click "Manage" (Settings Icon). Paste App ID (`755805226`).
*   **Say**: "Most demos stop there, but we built the **Full Lifecycle**. I click 'Manage', enter the ID, and sync with the blockchain. As the receiver, I can **'Claim Funds'**. If the deal fails, the payer can **'Refund'**. Complete control."

**(2:20 - 2:30) Outro**
*   **Visual**: GitHub Repo.
*   **Say**: "CampusPay makes DeFi accessible. It's live on Testnet. Check the code on GitHub. Thanks!"
